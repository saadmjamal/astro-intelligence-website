## The Challenge

Houston Property Services was struggling with manual quote generation for property maintenance services. Their process involved:
- Sales representatives manually calculating prices
- 2-3 day turnaround for complex quotes
- Inconsistent pricing across team members
- Lost opportunities due to slow response times

The company needed a solution that could:
- Generate accurate quotes instantly
- Maintain pricing consistency
- Handle complex property requirements
- Scale with business growth

## The Solution

I architected and built a comprehensive quote generation platform that leverages AI to analyze property details and generate accurate, consistent quotes in real-time. The system transforms how the company operates, turning a multi-day process into a matter of seconds.

### System Architecture

**Monorepo Structure:**
```

├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js customer portal
│   ├── admin/        # Admin dashboard
│   └── api/          # Fastify API server
├── packages/
│   ├── database/     # Shared Supabase schemas
│   ├── ui/          # Shared component library
│   └── utils/       # Common utilities
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Fastify for high-performance API

## Technical Deep Dive

### AI Pricing Algorithm

The quote generation engine uses multiple factors:

```typescript
interface QuoteFactors {
  propertySize: number;
  propertyType: 'residential' | 'commercial';
  serviceType: ServiceType[];
  urgency: 'standard' | 'rush' | 'emergency';
  seasonalAdjustment: number;
  historicalData: PricingHistory[];
}

async function generateQuote(factors: QuoteFactors): Promise<Quote> {
  // Base pricing calculation
  const basePrice = calculateBasePrice(factors);
  
  // AI adjustment based on historical data
  const aiAdjustment = await ai.predictOptimalPrice({
    ...factors,
    basePrice,
    marketConditions: await getMarketData()
  });
  
  // Apply business rules
  const finalPrice = applyBusinessRules(basePrice + aiAdjustment);
  
  return {
    price: finalPrice,
    breakdown: generateBreakdown(factors),
    validUntil: addDays(new Date(), 30)
  };
}
```

### Real-time Updates

Implemented WebSocket connections for live updates:

```typescript
// Real-time quote status updates
socket.on('quoteUpdate', (quoteId: string) => {
  // Update UI without page refresh
  updateQuoteStatus(quoteId);
  
  // Show notification
  showNotification('Your quote has been updated!');
});
```

### Security Implementation

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** in Supabase
- **API rate limiting** with Redis
- **Input validation** at every layer
- **Encrypted file uploads**
- **MFA for admin accounts**
