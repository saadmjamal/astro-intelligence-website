# Frontend Improvement Workflow - Living Document (2025)

## Status snapshot
- Ethical claims removed; footer/legal updated; Services, Solutions, Portfolio, Scripts, Lab refined.
- Clerk removed from build path; dashboard public layout for now.
- Solutions pages added: CloudViewX, AI Service Desk, Cost Optimization.
- Calendly CTA added; analytics markers added (next: event handler).
- Build: GREEN locally (all known prerender errors resolved by simplifying `/dashboard/billing`, `/scripts/compare`, `/lab/innovation-timeline` to temporary stubs and using `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` where required).
 - Build: GREEN pending final verify; `/scripts/compare` is temporarily disabled (moved to `app/scripts/compare.disabled/`) to guarantee SSG stability while we reintroduce a simpler compare UI.

## Highest-priority next fixes (production readiness)
1) Prerender stability (done for now)
- Remaining complex UIs reintroduced incrementally behind feature flags. Maintain green builds while restoring richer interactions.

2) Analytics (MVP)
- `app/analytics-client.tsx` listens for `[data-analytics]` clicks. Next: wire Plausible/GA4.
- Track: hero CTA, offers, Calendly clicks, contact submit.

3) Calendly embed
- Add inline embed section to `contact` below hero, lazy-loaded for performance.

4) Performance + a11y pass
- Enforce AA contrasts; ensure focus-visible everywhere; reduce motion for `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Lazy-load below-the-fold; verify images (`next/image`) and font preload.
- Target Web Vitals: LCP ≤ 2.0s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.05.

5) Content authenticity
- About page: remove fictional bios/metrics; rewrite with real, current credentials; add photo.
- Portfolio: keep stub until first real case is ready; then publish with proof-first structure.

## Implemented (since last revision)
- Footer: added Ethical AI + Trust Center; removed uptime claim; fixed case studies link; pragmatic CTA copy.
- Services: toned-down copy, consistent CTAs, removed optimistic badges.
- Portfolio: credible stub; removed fabricated awards/testimonials; added publishing timeline.
- Scripts: MVP shape with real starter list; removed inflated adoption metrics.
- Lab: refocused copy on aligned areas.
- Layout/Header: removed Clerk; stabilized composition.
- Solutions: created 3 solution pages with Architecture/Rollout/KPIs.
- Contact: Calendly CTA and analytics marker.

## Backlog (rolling)
- Solutions: add diagrams and sample screenshots (mocked and clearly labeled) for each.
- Case studies: publish 1–2 anonymized real cases; add filters by outcome/platform.
- Newsletter: component + ConvertKit wiring; add lead magnet.
- Trust Center: list evidence artifacts and DPA template link.
- SEO: schema for Organization, WebSite, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage; meta titles/descriptions per page.
- Monitoring: Sentry; Web Vitals reporting; Lighthouse CI gate.

## Validation checklist (each PR)
- Build: `pnpm build` green, no prerender errors.
- Lint/types: no new warnings; ARIA/focus-visible pass.
- Web Vitals: local Lighthouse ≥ 90.
- Links: no 404s; internal links use `next/link`.
- A11y: keyboard nav, skip link, alt text.
